<!--About me-->
## About me

I'm an IT student who likes to venture into the tech world, a born Gearhead passionate about sports cars. I had my first encounter with a computer as a child, at 7 years old, where I played games and surfed the internet. At the age of 12, I participated in a programming masterclass and discovered my passion. Since then, I have explored the field. I appreciate how technology offers opportunities and streamlines complex processes.

I have a technical degree in game programming and am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. My goal is to become a Full Stack developer, achieve complete proficiency in at least one programming language (C#), gain my first professional experience in the field and become fluent in a foreign language, starting with English and then Spanish.
