<!--About me-->
<h2>About me</h2>

I’m a passionate and tech-savvy IT student. I had my first encounter with a computer as a child at the age of 7, where I played games and surfed the internet. At 12, I participated in a programming masterclass and found my passion. Since then, I’ve been exploring the field. I appreciate how technology provides opportunities and streamlines complex processes.

I hold a technical degree in game programming and currently pursue Analysis and Systems Development. My goal is to become a Full Stack developer, achieve complete proficiency in a programming language (C#, Python, or JavaScript), gain my first professional experience in the field, and become fluent in a foreign language, starting with English and then Spanish.
